# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Added WPF UI with accessible GSX menu and tooltip viewer.
- Integrated Tolk screen reader support with separate “Speak menu” and “Speak tooltips” toggles; speech state now persists across runs.
- Laid out controls to avoid overlap; status, menu, and tooltip areas remain focusable and keyboard-friendly.
- Added user settings persistence and repository guidelines (`AGENTS.md`).
